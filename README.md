# Monkhouse — Static Website (Netlify + GitHub)

This is a static Monkhouse website starter structure.

## What this gives you
- Clean navigation across pages
- A daily Notice Board that reads from `/data/notice.json`
- Locations + Narrators starter pages
- A structure designed to expand without re-uploading everything

## How to deploy
1) Upload this folder into a GitHub repo
2) Connect Netlify to the repo
3) Netlify will auto-deploy whenever you commit changes

## Updating the Notice Board
Edit: `data/notice.json`
Commit the change → Netlify updates automatically.

Customers never interact with AI directly.
